# LU Decomposition Calculator (Python)

This project is a **Python-based LU Decomposition Solver** with a graphical interface (GUI). It allows users to input a square matrix \(A\) and a vector \(b\), then calculates the **LU decomposition** of \(A\) and solves the equation \(Ax = b\).

This tool is **educational** and suitable for small to medium-sized linear systems.
