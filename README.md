# LU Decomposition Calculator (Python)

This project is a **Python-based LU Decomposition Solver** with a graphical interface (GUI). It allows users to input a square matrix \(A\) and a vector \(b\), then calculates the **LU decomposition** of \(A\) and solves the equation \(Ax = b\).

This tool is **educational** and suitable for small to medium-sized linear systems.

## System Requirements

Before running the program, make sure you have:

- Python **3.10 – 3.14** installed  
- Tkinter (built into Python)  
- NumPy library  

---

## Installing Python (if not installed)

1. Go to [Python.org Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
2. Download the latest **Python version** (we recommend **3.12**)  
3. During installation, **check the following options**:  
   - “Add Python to PATH”  
   - “Install pip”  
   - “Install Tkinter” (optional but recommended)  
4. Finish installation

## Installing Required Libraries

The program requires **NumPy**. To install it:

1. Open **Command Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (Mac/Linux)**  
2. Type the following and press **Enter**:

## Running the Application

1. Download `LU_solver.py` from this repository.  
2. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and navigate to the folder where `LU_solver.py` is saved.  
3. Run the program by typing: python LU_solver.py

4. A window will appear where you can:  
   - Enter your square matrix \(A\)  
   - Enter the vector \(b\)  
   - Press the **Solve** button to compute the LU decomposition and see the solution \(x\) along with the computational steps.

## Advantages of the Python Version

- Run the solver locally without opening a web browser.  
- Python code is readable and can be studied or modified easily.  
- Easy to share as a standalone file with others.  

---

## Disadvantages of the Python Version
- Requires Python and NumPy installation, which may be an extra step for beginners.

## Notes

- This program is **educational**, so it is best for learning and small to medium matrices.  
- For very large matrices, more advanced numerical libraries or optimization may be needed.
